This projects aims to develop a community based learning repository for learning complex technologies. Software development if a never ending learning cycle, one of the biggest challenges that Software Engineers face is to constantly update themselves with cutting edge technologies and to best use practices and principles to develop thier products. Here we focus on: 
1. Over-engineering
2. Best practices

### Overengineering: Complexity ++
---
This project could very well have been a subreddit, **r/overengineeing** sure has got a ring to it. Having said that we decided to be true to our principles, so we `overengineered` it. How does this platform work? check out [here](contribute). Regardless, coming back to the principle of overengineering, we go by a simple rule **MAXIMIZE** build like there is no tomorrow! 

- Use the most complicated tech stack to build a todo-app! (nothing against todo apps, we love you)
- Use everything you can/ have to build something small.
- The more complicated it is, the better it is. 
- Prioritize on the design principles and tools not the business use cases! We know you can handle that when times comes!

### Best Practices: A Stitch in time, saves 9️⃣
---
This is very **IMPORTANT**. Best practices are designed to ensure production code runs smoothly when scaled, even after years even when cyborgs are gonna audit our code. As beginners or even experienced developers, we might not seem the use for best practices but these are time tested! Hence ensure you take your OCD pills and perfect this overengineered project. You might not be able to perfect you actual project, but here you can dash the T's and dot every single I. 

- Remember we here to learn, demonstrate. Not to sign off a JIRA ticket. 
- Flex your skills, we'd love to see you get lost in your own world of perfection
