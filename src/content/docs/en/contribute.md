### Why Contribute. Why here. How it works.
To put it in short, proof of work and community learning. Why here, because we came first :P. Jokes aside, this is a simple platform that gets you started with open-source content writing and technical writing. The ease of using markdown to format your article, and built in search with Algolia♥ helps readers find your article easily, due credit is automatically given to all contributors and all pages get a table of content ("On This Page") generated automatically, thereby helping you find articles in ease.

#### How it works: 
1. Your .md file is parsed by the Astro Engine♥ to render the pages.
2. As you upload the file, a record is inserted into Algolia♥ which helps in searching your documents.
3. It is as simple as that. Now your article get a T.O.P handle ⚙.
4. Our newsletter gives you technologies to look into every week*.


### Guidelines.
1. Articles will be approved by merging the pull requests.
2. These are articles are not expected to be step-by-step instructions. 
3. Comments will be given to PRs as needed.
4. We are starting off light with plagiarism :) We want you to get inspired!
5. Try to fill the content with architecture diagrams/ graphs anything that you want!
6. Finally try to provide a github link, if not just an abstract idea.
